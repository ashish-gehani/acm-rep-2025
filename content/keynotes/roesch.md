# This pulls in the content from the corresponding profile in the /content/authors directory, in this case /content/authors/hoefler.md. Add this in a new file for each speaker. The only thing that needs to change is the "weight:" and the "author:" attributes. The weight determines the order on the page. For this to work, the "author:" name needs to match the file name (without the ".md") in /content/authors.
