ACM REP '25 welcomes submissions across computing disciplines, spanning both traditional computer science and interdisciplinary scientific computing applications in biology, chemistry, physics, astronomy, genomics, geosciences, etc. The conference particularly values submissions that demonstrate reproducible experimental results. Where full reproduction is not achieved, detailed documentation of the reproducibility experience is equally valuable.

The conference addresses various aspects of reproducibility and replicability, including but not limited to the following topics: 

### Reproducibility Concepts 
- Experiment dependency management.
- Experiment portability for code, performance, and related metrics.
- Software and artifact packaging and container-related reproducibility methods. 
- Approximate reproducibility. 
- Record and replay methods. 
- Data versioning and preservation.
- Provenance of data-intensive experiments.
- Automated experiment execution and validation.
- Reproducibility-aware computational infrastructure.
- Experiment discoverability for re-use.
- Approaches for advancing reproducibility.

### Reproducibility Experiences
- Experience of sharing and consuming reproducible artifacts. 
- Conference-scale artifact evaluation experiences and practices.
- Experiences as part of hackathons and summer programs.
- Classroom and teaching experiences. 
- Usability and adaptability of reproducibility frameworks into already-established domain-specific tools.
- Frameworks for sociological constructs to incentivize paradigm shifts.
- Policies around publication of articles/software.
- Experiences within computational science communities.
- Experience comparing published systems in a domain.

### Broader Reproducibility
- Cost-benefit analysis frameworks for reproducibility.
- Novel methods and techniques that impact reproducibility.
- Reusability, repurposability, and replicability methods. 
- Long-term artifact archiving and verification/testing for future reproducibility.
