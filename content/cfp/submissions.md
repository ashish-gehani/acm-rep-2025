We solicit papers describing original work relevant to reproducibility and independent verification of scientific results. The submission must not be published or under review elsewhere. ACM REP 2025 is a **double-blind** reviewed conference. Author names should not be included. Past work should be referred to in the third person. Self-citations and supplementary material (including code repositories) should also be anonymized.

ACM REP submissions can be research, survey, vision, or experience papers. Submissions will be evaluated according to their significance, originality, technical content, style, clarity, relevance, and likelihood of generating discussion. Authors should note that changes to the author list after the submission deadline are not allowed without permission from the PC Chairs. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for, attend, and present the work at the conference.

### Research Papers (Long and Short)

We solicit both full length papers (10 pages) and short papers (4 pages). The former tend to be descriptions of complete technical work, while the latter tend to be descriptions of interesting, innovative ideas, which nevertheless require more effort to mature. The page limit is without references and/or appendices. The Program Committee may decide to accept some full papers as poster papers. Full and short papers will be given a presentation slot in the conference. All papers, regardless of size, will be given an entry in the conference proceedings.

### Artifact Availability Criteria

For full papers with experimental results, submission of accompanying artifacts is mandatory. The artifacts will be reviewed by the Program Committee, and those that pass will be awarded [Artifact Availability Badges](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current) per ACM policy.

### Formatting 

Papers must be submitted in PDF format according to the ACM template published in the ACM guidelines, selecting the generic “sigconf” sample. The PDF files must have all non-standard fonts embedded. Papers must be self-contained and in English. If submitting a short paper, authors must indicate “SHORT:” at the beginning of the title. The review process is double-blind.
