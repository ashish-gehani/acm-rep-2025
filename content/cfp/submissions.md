We solicit papers describing original work relevant to reproducibility and independent verification of scientific results. And not published or under review elsewhere. ACM REP is a single-blind reviewed conference. Therefore, authors must include their names and affiliations on the first page. ACM REP submissions can be either research papers, surveys, vision, and experience papers. Papers will be evaluated according to their significance, originality, technical content, style, clarity, relevance, and likelihood of generating discussion. Authors should note that changes to the author list after the submission deadline are not allowed without permission from the PC Chairs. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for, attend, and present the work at the conference.

### Research Papers (Long and Short)

We solicit both full length papers (10 pages) and short papers (4 pages). The former tend to be descriptions of complete technical work, while the latter tend to be descriptions of interesting, innovative ideas, which nevertheless require more work to mature. The program committee may decide to accept some full papers as short papers. Full papers will be given a presentation slot in the conference, while short papers will be presented in the form of posters. All papers regardless of size, will be given an entry in the conference proceedings. The requested page limit is without references. Authors may optionally include reproducibility information that allows for automated validation of experimental results (see artifact evaluation criteria) Accepted submissions passing automated validation will earn the ACM Reproducibility badges in accordance with the artifact review and validation policy.

### Artifact Evaluation Criteria

The conference will also be soliciting code/data artifacts. For submitted papers, these artifacts will be optional supplemental material and solicited based on the PC criteria. The artifacts will be mandatory for accepted full papers with experimental results. The artifacts will be reviewed by an Artifact Evaluation committee, and those that pass will be awarded [Reproducibility Badges](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current) per ACM policy. 

### Formatting 

Papers must be submitted in PDF format according to the ACM template published in the ACM guidelines, selecting the generic “sigconf” sample. The PDF files must have all non-standard fonts embedded. Papers must be self-contained and in English. If submitting a short paper, authors must indicate "SHORT:" at the beginning of the title. The review process is single-blind.
