        This recognition is not only a sign of respect, but also an act of awareness and ongoing commitment to the Indigenous peoples whose relationship with this land continues to this day.

        To learn more about UBC’s connection to the land and its relationship with the Musqueam Nation, we encourage you to explore the following resources:
