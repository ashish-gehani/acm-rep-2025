        Most travelers will need a **Visitor Visa (Temporary Resident Visa)** or an **Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA)** to enter Canada. Some may only need a valid passport. Use the Government of Canadaâ€™s official tool to determine what you need and apply online:

        Include the following information with your request:
        - Your name as it appears on your passport
