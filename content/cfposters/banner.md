The ACM Conference on Reproducibility and Replicability invites poster submissions showcasing innovative research and practical insights. Submissions should consist of a 2-page extended abstract, formatted according to the ACM standard conference template, clearly highlighting the contribution's relevance to reproducibility and replicability. Abstracts will undergo a review for applicability and will be competitively selected based on quality and available poster space. More details [here](#submissions).

We are using the following definitions of reproducibility and replicability as presented in the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine report ["Reproducibility and Replication in Science"](https://doi.org/10.17226/25303) ([overview](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/reproducibility-and-replicability-in-science)):

- Reproducibility is obtaining consistent results using the same input data, computational steps, methods, and code, and conditions of
analysis. This definition is synonymous with “computational reproducibility.”
- Replicability is obtaining consistent results across studies aimed at answering the same scientific question, each of which has obtained
its own data. Two studies may be considered to have replicated if they obtain consistent results given the level of uncertainty inherent in the system under study.

The ACM REP conference series is associated with the [ACM Emerging Interest Group for Reproducibility and Replicability](https://reproducibility.acm.org/) (see [here](https://acm-rep.github.io/history) for ACM REP's history). 

All accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library.
