To submit a poster, authors must upload a 2-page extended abstract via the [EasyChair submission site, selecting the Poster option](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=acmrep2025). Submissions must follow the ACM standard conference template and clearly include all content within the required two pages. Abstracts will be evaluated for applicability and quality, and selections will be based on the availability of poster space. 

Accepted posters should conform to an A0 portrait format for presentation at the conference.

**At least one author of each accepted poster is required to register for the conference.** Authors of accepted posters are expected to present a brief overview of their work during a lightning talk session. Only authors attending the conference in person will receive space to display their posters. Authors unable to attend in person will not be allocated poster space; however, they will still have the opportunity to deliver their lightning talk remotely or via prerecorded presentation.
