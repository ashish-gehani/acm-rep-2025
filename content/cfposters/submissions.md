To submit a 2-page extended abstract for a poster, please use [EasyChair submission site and choose the Posters track](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=acmrep24) (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=acmrep24). Each submission needs to consist of a 2-page extended abstract, including all content, following the ACM standard conference template. These 2-page abstracts will be reviewed for applicability and downselected for quality based on available poster space.  

Posters selected for presentation at the conference must fit within an A0 portrait size.

Authors of accepted poster submissions are expected to give a short talk about their poster in a lightening talk session. Of these authors only those who attend in person will get poster space. Of those who are not able to attend in person will not be given poster space but will still be able to present a remote/prerecorded lightening talk.
